# MyWheels Frontend Technical Interview

This repository serves as a minimal setup to do the technical interview in. Before the technical interview, please make sure to have this setup up and running on your machine. If you encounter any problems with the setup, please let us know ahead of time.

Clone this repository, install dependencies using `npm install` and run the project using `npm run dev`. Please confirm that any changes made in `src/App.tsx` are reflected live.

No further preparation is needed. During the technical interview, you will receive an assignment. While doing this assignment, it is important to talk through what you are doing and explain the decisions you make. We care more about the way you approach problems than about how far you complete the assignment.
