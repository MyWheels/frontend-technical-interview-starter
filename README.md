# MyWheels Frontend Technical Interview

During the technical interview, you will receive an assignment. This repository serves as a minimal setup to be able to do the assignment in. Before the technical interview, please make sure to have this setup up and running on your machine. If you encounter any problems with the setup, please let us know ahead of time.

Clone this repository, install dependencies using `npm install` and run the project using `npm run dev`. Please confirm that any changes made in `src/App.tsx` are reflected live.

The assignment won't be design heavy, but Tailwind is configured so some minor styling can be quickly added. If you prefer a different styling solution, feel free to set it up ahead of the interview.
